"log001.dat" contains test signals designed to test how various kinds
of signal changes and modulation are detected by different analysis
methods.

"example.dat" is an excerpt of the file "downey.dat" which is
available from Jim Meissner's site.  It is a historical recording of a
gifted psychic in action.  Pick up the original file from Jim
Meissner's site for the entire recording, and for additional notes on
this session.


These files can be viewed with the follow options:
