Ich hatte bei Emotiv wegen der defekten Kontakte angefragt, und diese
Anleitung zum Wiederbeleben erhalten:

Hi Wolfgang,

Thank you for your email The EPOC hydrator pack is a consumable product and
needs to be replaced from time to time.  What you are seeing is not
corrison. It's oxidation which is normal.  Users will need to maintain the
contacts to keep them operating like new. You will need the following items from
your local pharmacy or drug store:
 
* Quantity of 0.4% to 0.9% saline.  Small quantity (50 mil) pure isopropyl
* alcohol.  Six good quality cotton (ear) buds.

Following the instructions provided by Emotiv systems, remove all of the
contacts from the headset arms (or fingers). Remove the felt pads and soak them
in a flat dish with about 2 mm of saline on the bottom. While the felt pads are
soaking, wet a cotton bud with the alcohol and rub only the rear of the gold
contact in the felt pad holder.

IMPORTANT: You should not clean the front section which contacts directly onto
the felt, and you may damage the electrolytic coating. If there is a buildup of
salts, let it soak a while in saline or fresh water and try again later. If
necessary, flush out any debris from the salts using either alcohol or saline.

IMPORTANT: Never use any type of sharp item to scrape the salts off. Even the
 smallest scratch will damage the contact and the underlying metal will be
 destroyed in time by the electrolysys process.  Once all the gold contacts have
 been cleaned, you should now revive the felt pads. Salts tend to build up
 within the internal felt structure as vertical columns. You can often detect
 this by squeezing the pad sideways and then comparing that to squeezing it
 vertically. If it appears brittle or is noticeably stiffer when you compress it
 vertically, this is a good indication there is a columnar buildup. If needed,
 fully saturate the pad in saline for ten minutes then carefully squeeze it
 vertically to half its height then reshape it round again. If you flatten it
 too much, the pad may break apart. Repeat this a few times for each pad. You
 should notice a significant increase in comfort when you next use the
 headset. One at a time, shake off the excess saline from the pad and re-insert
 it into its holder. Screw the holder and pad assembly into the socket on the
 headset arm. At all times, you should avoid letting any liquid get into the
 electronics. Connect everything up again a nd test the headset with the Emotiv
 Control Panel.
